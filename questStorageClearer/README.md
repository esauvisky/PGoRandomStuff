# How to use:

    $ bash ./questStorageCleaner.sh

_(Needs bash, doesn't work with plain sh)_


## Tips:

- When recording a new macro for certain pokemon, make sure you do the two throws **one for each side!**. This way, if the pokemon moves side-to-side, you can still get lucky and hit him,

- Record until you miss, he attacks, or whatever: record until the first ball doesn't work, so you get the timing for the second right.

- **Do not** click the exit button on the recording itself!
